This component is really simple to use. You can easily customize the fonts and colors. It resizes automatically according to its configuration.
### Features
- Custolizable font and color.
- As many digits as you need (from 1 to +∞).
- AutoLayout compatible (`intrinsicContentSize` updated according to the configuration).
- Interface-Builder compatible.
- Pure Swift 5.
- Open project: you have an issue or an idea ? Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/jlnquere/PinInputView/issues/new), or submit a PR :)
